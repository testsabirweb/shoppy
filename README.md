# FrizzlingRecepies 

This is a fully native app similar to OLX ,where an user can come to sell and buy.
The user can easily add the product to cart if he wants to buy,and also can easily sell a product to an another user just following simple steps.

This app works with firebase authentication therefore it's safe and secure.

The app is built with react-native therefore compatible for both ios and android,and it as well 
gives native look on both.It uses Firebase(Real time) as a database
